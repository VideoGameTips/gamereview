## 🧊 What Happens in the Book

In *Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Meltdown*, a big **snowstorm shuts down Greg’s school**, and chaos breaks loose in his neighborhood. All the kids get involved in a **massive snowball fight**, turning the block into a wild winter battlefield.

Greg joins the snowball fight but faces a lot of **failures**. For example, when he throws a snowball at someone, the crowd turns on him, and **everyone starts throwing snowballs at Greg** instead.

## ❄️ My Favorite Part

The part I liked the most was definitely the **snowball throwing** scenes. It was full of action, excitement, and silliness, just like a big snow day should be.

---

## 💭 What I Didn’t Like

The only thing I didn’t enjoy as much was that the story felt a bit **chaotic and hard to follow at times**. There was so much happening that it kind of made my brain feel a little messy.

---

## 😂 Funniest Moment

The funniest part in the book is when **Greg and his best friend Rowley build an igloo**, but **forget to build a door**! They start **suffocating** inside, and after they finally escape, **random neighborhood kids pelt them with snowballs** — because their **heads poking out of the igloo** made them perfect targets.

## 👀 Character Insight

In all the *Wimpy Kid* books, **Greg always seems to think everyone else is being an idiot**. He often blames other people for what goes wrong, even when it's partly his fault. This makes him a funny but also very flawed and interesting character.

*The Meltdown* is a funny and action-packed entry in the *Wimpy Kid* series. It’s full of winter adventures, silly mistakes, and nonstop snowball madness. If you like books with wild humor and relatable disasters, this one’s a great pick!
