## 🌟 Why I Like This Book

*Diary of a Wimpy Kid* is one of my favorite books. It’s funny, easy to read, and full of relatable moments from middle school life.

## 👦 Main Characters

- **Greg Heffley** – The main character, a middle school kid who tries to become popular.
- **Rowley Jefferson** – Greg’s best friend, who is cheerful and loyal.

## 📚 What Happens in the Book

Greg is always trying to come up with creative ways to be popular at school, but things never go according to plan. In fact, most of his ideas backfire in funny and surprising ways.

One of my favorite parts is when Greg joins the wrestling team and realizes that wrestling in real life is not at all like what he imagined. Another funny scene is when some teenagers spray Greg and Rowley with a fire extinguisher.

## ⚠️ A Mistake Greg Made

The biggest mistake Greg made in the book was when he signed up to be a safety patrol. He ended up getting kicked out because he chased some kindergartners with worms. But the worst part was that he was wearing **Rowley's coat**, so the school blamed **Rowley** for it instead.

Greg didn’t tell the truth right away, and Rowley got in trouble for something he didn’t do. I think Greg should have told the principal what really happened. Because he didn’t, he not only got kicked out of the safety patrol later, but also **hurt Rowley’s feelings**, and Rowley started to think Greg was being kind of a jerk.

## ❤️ What I Liked Most

The part I liked the most was when Rowley thinks Greg isn’t being a good friend and decides to hang out with other people. Eventually, both Greg and Rowley miss each other, and Greg realizes that being popular isn't as great as he thought. He chooses to go back to being friends with Rowley, which was a really nice moment.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

This book shows that friendship is more important than popularity. It’s full of humor and life lessons, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes funny stories about growing up.
