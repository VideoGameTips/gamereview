## 🧟‍♂️ What Happens in Book #5

In this story, one of the main characters’ friends, **Jez**, discovers a mysterious **portal** — and suddenly, **zombies start coming out of it**! Things get worse when Jez's little brother **Max**, got infected and turned into zombies.

At first, the kids try to fight back, but all they have with them are **water blasters brought by Max, chips, and sodas**. That sounds useless…especially the water blaster... until they find out that **sodas can actually melt zombies**!

To save Max from turning into a zombie forever, they have to team up and **defeat the boss zombie**.

## 💬 Character Development

Earlier in the book, **Jez thinks her little brother Max is just plain annoying**. But after everything they go through, **Max realizes that his sister doesn’t actually hate him**. This shows how their relationship grows stronger through the adventure.

## 🌟 Favorite Part

My favorite part of the book is when the characters **decide to fight the zombies instead of running away**. They want to protect their friends and their brothers, which shows courage and loyalty. That moment was both exciting and meaningful.
